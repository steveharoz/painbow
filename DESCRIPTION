Title: Use XKCD's "Painbow" Colormap in Base and ggplot2 Graphics
Version: 1.1.0
Author: Steve Haroz
Maintainer: Steve Haroz <painbow@steveharoz.com>
Description: XKCD described a supposedly "bad" colormap that it called a "Painbow" (see <https://xkcd.com/2537/>). But simple tests demonstrate that under some circumstances, the colormap can perform very well, and people can find information that is difficult to detect with the ggplot2 default and even supposedly "good" colormaps like viridis. This package lets you use the Painbow in your own base and ggplot2 graphics.
