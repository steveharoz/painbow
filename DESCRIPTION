Title: Use XKCD's "Painbow" Colormap in ggplot2
Version: 1.0.1
Author: Steve Haroz
Maintainer: Steve Haroz <painbow@steveharoz.com>
Description: XKCD described a supposedly "bad" colormap that it called a "Painbow" (see <https://xkcd.com/2537/>). But simple tests demonstrate that under some circumstances, the colormap can perform very well, and people can find information that is difficult to detect with the ggplot2 default and even supposedly "good" colormaps like viridis. This library let's you use the Painbow in your own ggplot graphs.
